High Performance Computing
===========================

For some homework assignments, your laptop or desktop computer may not be powerful enough to run the code in a reasonable amount of time. In these cases, you may want to use a high performance computing (HPC) cluster. This tutorial will show you how to run your code on the HPC cluster `Expanse <https://www.sdsc.edu/support/user_guides/expanse.html>`_ at the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC).

.. note::
    This tutorial assumes that you have an account at `ACCESS <https://access-ci.org/>`_, have sent your ACCESS username to the instructor, and the instructor has added you to the class project on Expanse.

.. note::
    Here is the full `Expanse User Guide <https://www.sdsc.edu/support/user_guides/expanse.html>`_. We will only need a small subset of the information in this guide, but you may find it useful to refer to the full guide if you have any questions.
