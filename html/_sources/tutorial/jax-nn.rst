Neural networks with JAX
========================
Working with neural networks in JAX is quite different from that in PyTorch.
Here is a `tutorial <https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/Neural_Network_and_Data_Loading.html>`_ of training a simple neural network in pure JAX.

Libraries are available to make working with neural networks in JAX easier.
Examples include `Equinox <https://github.com/patrick-kidger/equinox>`_ and 
`Flax <https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
In this course, we recommend using `Equinox` and here is a `tutorial <https://docs.kidger.site/equinox/examples/mnist/>`_ on training a convolutional neural network on the MNIST dataset using Equinox.
